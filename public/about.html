<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>My name is Lydia Isioma Anomfueme. I'm 25 years old. I'm currently working as an admin manager at Tpaul Integrated Services Limited. I own the brand LuxeBloom Essentials.
  It's a lifestyle brand that deals on Skincare products, Perfumes and Jewelry. My current location is Port Harcourt. </p>

<p>I also have a skincare blog that I run in my spare time. I enjoy learning and I also consider myself to be a fast learner. I enjoy movies, I like to read though i haven't gotten around to reading in a very long time and would really love to get back in the game. Hopefully soon</p>

<p>I'm currently learning frontend development and I'm really passionate about it and can't wait to master the art. So, this is my little about. Thanks for reading </p>
