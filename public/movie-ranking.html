<h1>Kdrama Ranking - Lydia's Version</h1>
<h2>Top Three KDramas I've Seen This Year</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Coffee Prince</h3>
<p>This is a very old kdrama but it's interesting. And it gives that nostalgic feeling. They honestly don't make kdramas like that anymore. Sigh</p>
<h3>Flex Cops</h3> 
<p>I'm finding it hard to remember the really good stuffs.</p>
<h4>Juvenile Justice</h4>
<p>My action woman that acted "under th queens umbrella" is the lead. It's nowhere near the drama in the apostrophe but overall, it's not bad</p>
